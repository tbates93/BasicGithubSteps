# Basic Github Steps

# 1) Fork the repo
   This will make a copy of the repository on your Github account.
   <br>It is important to do this step first, or you won't be able to save the changes you make to the code.
   <br>Remember:
   <br> This is a button on the github website up in the right hand corner of the repo you want to copy

# 2) Clone the repo FROM YOUR ACCOUNT, NOT DEVMOUNTAIN'S ACCOUNT (or any other account that you are copying repos from)
   This downloads a copy of the code onto your computer. Then, when you commit your code you can push the changes up to Github to be saved onto your account.
   <br>If you forget to fork, or if you fork but forget to clone FROM YOUR COPY you cannot push your changes to Github and save your progress.
   <br>Remember:
   <br>  git clone [url of the repo here]

# 3) Make your changes to the code and commit often
   Work on your project and remember to commit often.
   <br>Remember:
   <br> git status
   <br> git add [whatever files you want to save]
   <br> git commit -m 'I AM A MESSAGE'

# 4) Save your changes on Github
   <br>When you've made good progress or you've finished with your project, you're going to push your changes to github.
   <br>Remember:
   <br> git push origin master

# 4.5 ) Push a few times a day
   You can push as many times as you need to. I would recommend commiting (see step 3) several times a day, and pushing once or twice (when you've finished a significant junk of code)

# 5 Test stuff out
